For example, the plaintext DASHBOARD is encrypted with the keyword LINUX:\n &nbsp;&nbsp; Plaintext: DASHBOARD\n &nbsp;&nbsp; Keyword:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LINUXLINU\n So, the first letter D is paired with the first letter of the key L. Therefore, row D and column L of the  Vigenère square are used to get the first cipher letter O. This must be repeated for the whole ciphertext.\n\n You are given an array with two elements:\n &nbsp;&nbsp;[\"MOUSEMACROMODEMARRAYPRINT\", \"VERSION\"]\n The first element is the plaintext, the second element is the keyword.\n\n Return the ciphertext as uppercase string."

The first element of the data represents the number of vertices in the graph. Each vertex is a unique number between 0 and 12. The next element of the data represents the edges of the graph. Two vertices u,v in a graph are said to be adjacent if there exists an edge [u,v]. Note that an edge [u,v] is the same as an edge [v,u], as order does not matter. You must construct a 2-coloring of the graph, meaning that you have to assign each vertex in the graph a \"color\", either 0 or 1, such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color. Submit your answer in the form of an array, where element i represents the color of vertex i. If it is impossible to construct a 2-coloring of the given graph, instead submit an empty array.\n\n Examples:\n\n Input: [4, [[0, 2], [0, 3], [1, 2], [1, 3]]]\n Output: [0, 0, 1, 1]\n\n Input: [3, [[0, 1], [0, 2], [1, 2]]]\n Output: []"
