Watch the Hamming code video from 3Blue1Brown for more information\n Note 3: There's a ~55% chance for an altered Bit. So... MAYBE there is an altered Bit ðŸ˜‰\n Note: The endianness of the encoded decimal value is reversed in relation to the endianness of the Hamming code. Where the Hamming code is expressed as little-endian (LSB at index 0), the decimal value encoded in it is expressed as big-endian (MSB at index 0).\n Extra note for automation: return the decimal value as a string"
